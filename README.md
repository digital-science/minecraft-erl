Welcome to the awesome world of connecting to a Minecraft server from ERLANG!

## Get the server

`make server`

This will download the server jar into the server/ subdirectory and run it. Open another terminal window to carry on.

## Compile/run the code

`make run`

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
